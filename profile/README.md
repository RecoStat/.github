# RECOSTAT workshop 2024

RECOSTAT workshops are dedicated to research on magnetic reconnection with an emphasis on using space plasma data with a statistical approach.

The topic of the 2024 edition of the RECOSTAT workshop is the *location of the reconnection X line(s) at the Earth Magnetopause*. The objective is to work on the problem with new transverse ideas, by gathering in the same room for a full week, international experts with diverse and complementary skills in:

- global magnetohydrodynamics modeling of the magnetosphere
- kinetic numerical modeling of the magnetic reconnection process
- magnetic reconnection theory
- in situ spacecraft observation
- statistical analysis and machine learning

Beyond sharing and fostering new ideas, the workshop also aims at sharing know-how and skills in the diverse methodologies, tools and techniques among participants, in particular for young scientists and PhD students.

## Participants

- The workshop gather an international team limited to 15 people on invitation-only mode.
- Participants will be listed here later.

## Dates

- Arrival on Sunday March 24th 2024
- Departure on Saturday March 30th 2024

## Program

#### Friday March 22

As a preamble to the workshop, participants are welcome to attend the PhD defense of Bayane Michotte de Welle that will take place on Friday March 22 [at Ecole Polytechnique near Paris](https://www.lpp.polytechnique.fr/Comment-venir-au-LPP?lang=en).
#### Sunday March 24: Arrival in Belle-ile
- Travel from Paris Montparnasse to Kervilahouen
- Dinner in Belle-ile (at participants' own cost) in a restaurant nearby the hamlet

#### Day 1 - Monday 25: presentation day

The goal of this day to browse the main ideas, evidences, **and above all open questions** from simulations, theory, observations that constrain the orientation and location of X line(s) on the magneopause.

Presentation titles will come later.

From now on the main goal of the following days will be to split days between:

- **splinter work sessions** during which self-organized teams can explore/test new ideas, either in the seminar room, or in separate houses (all equipped with internet)...

... or go for a walk in the area (see below for a pic. taken ~10min walking distance from our hamlet) to foster new ideas and informal discussions...

- **debriefs sessions** during which we all touch base on what is done / difficulties / results
- **presentations / tutorial sessions**, where participants get the opportunity to teach and learn methodological skills to/from others (reconnection theory concepts, in situ data analysis techniques and tools, what is and how to use machine learning, how to perform simulations etc.)
